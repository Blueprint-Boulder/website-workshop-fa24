        <h2>Getting Started with the Terminal</h2>
        <p>
          The terminal can feel intimidating, but it's a superpower once you get
          the hang of it. Let's start by opening the terminal on your device:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Mac:</strong> Open Spotlight Search (⌘ + Space), type
            "Terminal," and press Enter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Windows:</strong> Press the Windows key, type "Command
            Prompt" or "PowerShell," and press Enter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Linux:</strong> Open your applications menu and search for
            "Terminal."
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Challenge 1: Where Are You?</h2>
        <p>
          Once your terminal is open, use a command to find out where you are.
          After that, list the other files and folders in your current location.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hint:</strong> You've seen the commands to do this before in
          the <a href="terminal-commands.html">Terminal Commands</a> page.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Challenge 2: Create and Navigate</h2>
        <p>
          Next, create a folder for this workshop and navigate into it—all in
          one line. Here's a tip: You can chain commands with <code>;</code> to
          run them sequentially.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hint:</strong> Use a combination of the commands to create a
          folder and change directories.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Double Hint:</strong> Use tab to autocomplete file names. Very
          useful feature.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Challenge 3: Files, Files, Files</h2>
        <p>
          Inside your workshop folder, create an <code>index.html</code> file,
          and a <code>style.css</code> file. We'll be using these later. Now
          list them, to make sure they exist.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ok I lied. Now delete the files. Play around with deleting and adding
          files. Say you had two <code>.html</code> files, or 100. Could you
          figure out a way to delete all of them at the same time?
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hint:</strong> Use wildcard operators to delete all files at
          once!
        </p>

        <h2>Challenge 4: Organize Your Workspace</h2>
        <p>
          Finally, move your now-empty workshop folder into the location where
          you keep your coding projects. If you don't have a dedicated folder
          for coding yet, now's a great time to create one!
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hint:</strong> Think about how to use a command to move a
          folder to a new location.
        </p>

        <h2>Final Check</h2>
        <p>
          Congratulations! Your terminal is warmed up, and your workspace is
          ready for action. You've practiced navigating, creating, listing, and
          deleting files and folders—all essential skills for any coder.

          When you're ready, move on to the next page to create your GitHub
          account and continue the workshop.
