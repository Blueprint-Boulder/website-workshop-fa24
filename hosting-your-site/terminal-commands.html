        <h2>Terminal Trauma</h2>
        <p>
          Look, the terminal can feel a little... intimidating. Everything's
          black and white, no buttons to click, no icons to drag. And things
          have gotten pretty button-y and drag-y these days. Most of the time,
          you can do everything with two or three clicks. It's awesome.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, there are some things—like what we're doing today—that are
          much easier (and faster!) in the terminal. Once you get the hang of
          it, you'll find it's not as scary as it seems. We promise.

        <h2>Common Commands</h2>
        <p>
          Here's a quick rundown of the commands we'll be using throughout the
          workshop. We've grouped them by category for easy reference!

            GitHub.
            <pre><span class="standard-command">cat</span> ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</pre>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Flags</h3>
        <p>
          Flags are like modifiers for terminal commands. They add extra
          functionality or tweak how a command behaves. Think of them as the
          sprinkles on your ice cream—totally optional, but they make everything
          better.
        </p>
        <p>
          Flags usually come after the main command and are preceded by a dash
          (`-`). Some flags have a single dash (e.g., `-r`), while others have
          double dashes (e.g., `--help`). Here's an example:
        </p>
        <pre><span class="standard-command">ls</span> <span class="flag">-l</span></pre>
        <p>
          This command lists files in long format, showing extra details like
          permissions and file sizes. Below are the other flags we'll use
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <code><span class="flag">--sparse</span></code
            >: Clone only specific parts of a repository. This is only a
            <span class="flag">flag</span> for
            <code><span class="git">git</span></code> commands.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><span class="flag">-r</span></code
            >: Recursive—used to perform actions on directories and their
            contents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><span class="flag">-t</span></code
            >: This flag specifies the type of key to create. In this workshop,
            we use <code>ed25519</code>, a modern and secure key type.
          </li>
          <li>
            <code><span class="flag">-C</span></code
            >: This flag allows you to add a comment to your SSH key, often used
            to identify it. In this case, we use your GitHub email address as
            the comment.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>Understanding <code class="git-command">ssh-keygen</code></h2>
        <p>
          The <code class="git-command">ssh-keygen</code> command generates a
          new SSH key pair. This command creates both a public key (which you
          share with GitHub) and a private key (which stays secure on your
          computer). You'll encounter this command when setting up SSH for
          secure authentication.
