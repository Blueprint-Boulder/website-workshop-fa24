        <h2>Challenge: Push Your Files with Clarity</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you've moved your files to the repository, it's time to push
          them to GitHub. But wait—we're not just going to dump everything in
          one go! This challenge is all about organizing your commits to make
          them clearer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Imagine you're working on a project with a team. It's important for
          everyone to understand exactly what changes you've made. By splitting
          your commits into logical groups, like HTML files and CSS files, your
          work becomes much easier to follow.
        </p>
        <h3>Your Mission</h3>
        <p>Use the terminal commands you've learned to:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Create a commit that includes only your HTML files. (Hint: Use the
            wildcard operator to target files ending in <code>.html</code>.)
          </li>
          <li>Create a second commit that includes only your CSS files.</li>
          <li>Once your commits are ready, push everything to GitHub!</li>
        </ol>
      </section>

        <h2>Commands to Help You</h2>
        <p>
          Here's the first step and the final push command to help you get
          started:
        </p>
        <pre><span class="git">git</span> <span class="git-command">remote</span> <span class="git-command">add</span> origin <code>&lt;repo_url&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>Adds the remote repository link to your local repository.</p>
        <pre><span class="git">git</span> <span class="git-command">push</span> -u origin main</pre>
        <p>
          Pushes all your committed changes to the <code>main</code> branch on
          GitHub.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hint:</strong> By using wildcard operators, we can target any
          type of file. Including folders. Consider <code>**/*.js</code>: this
          would target any js files, even if they're inside another folder.
        </p>

        <h2>Part 3: Hosting with GitHub Pages</h2>
        <p>
          Once your files are pushed to GitHub, make your website live by
          enabling GitHub Pages:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Go to your repository on GitHub and click <strong>Settings</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scroll down to the <strong>Pages</strong> section in the sidebar.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under <strong>Branch</strong>, select <code>main</code> and click
            <strong>Save</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            After a few moments, GitHub will provide you with a link to your
            live website. Test the link to ensure it's working!
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Once your website is live, take a moment to admire your work—you've
          officially hosted your first website using GitHub Pages!
