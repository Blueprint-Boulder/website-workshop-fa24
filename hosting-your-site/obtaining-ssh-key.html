        <h2>Why Do You Need an SSH Key?</h2>
        <p>
          You might be wondering: Why do I even need an SSH Key? Well, an SSH
          key is like a VIP pass for your computer to access GitHub securely,
          without needing to type your password every time you use Git. It makes
          life easier and keeps your account safe.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how it works:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Your computer generates a pair of cryptographic keys: one public and
            one private.
          </li>
          <li>
            The public key is like a lock you share with GitHub, and the private
            key is the key that stays on your computer.
          </li>
          <li>
            When you try to access GitHub, your computer "unlocks" the
            connection using your private key. Simple and secure!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          P.S: This means that you'll have to generate an SSH key for every
          device you plan on using Github with, or at least all the ones where
          you're going to work with a repo.

        <h2>How to Generate and Add Your SSH Key</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Open your terminal and enter the following command to generate your
            key pair:
            <pre><span class="git-command">ssh-keygen</span> <span class="flag">-t</span> ed25519 <span class="flag">-C</span> "your_email@example.com"</pre>
            <p>
              Replace
              <code>your_email@example.com</code> with the email you used for
              GitHub.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press
            <code>Enter</code> to accept the default file location.
          </li>
          <li>
            When prompted for a passphrase, either enter one (for extra
            security) or leave it blank and press
            <code>Enter</code>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now, copy your public key to your clipboard:
            <pre><span class="standard-command">cat</span> ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</pre>
            <p>
              Highlight the output and copy it (you'll need it for the next
              step).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            Go back to GitHub, click on your profile picture in the top-right
            corner, and navigate to <strong>Settings</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Under the "Access" section in the sidebar, select
            <strong>SSH and GPG keys</strong>, then click
            <strong>New SSH key</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            Paste your public key into the text box, give it a recognizable
            title (e.g., "My Laptop" or "Macbook Pro [Name]"), and click
            <strong>Add SSH key</strong>.
          </li>
          <li>
            To verify everything's working, go back to your terminal and run:
            <pre><span class="standard-command">ssh</span> <span class="flag">-T</span> git@github.com</pre>
            <p>
              If everything's set up correctly, you'll see a message like, "Hi
              [username]! You've successfully authenticated."
            </p>
          </li>
