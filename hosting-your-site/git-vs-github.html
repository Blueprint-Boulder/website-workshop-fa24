        <h2>Why Version Control is the Hero You Didn't Know You Needed</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine this: you're a coder, writing the best script of your life.
          But uh-oh! You make a change and it breaks everything. Wouldn't it be
          great if you could time-travel to a version of your code that actually
          worked? <strong>Enter version control.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Version control is like having a save button for every step of your
          coding journey. It tracks your changes, lets you revert to an earlier
          state, and helps you collaborate with other developers.

        <h2>Git: The Time-Traveling Version Control Wizard</h2>
        <p>
          Git is a tool that runs on your computer and gives you the magic of
          version control. It keeps track of changes to your code, lets you
          create branches to experiment safely, and merges changes seamlessly.

        <h2>GitHub: Git's Cloudy Cousin</h2>
        <p>
          GitHub takes all that Git goodness and puts it online. It's like
          Dropbox, but specifically for code. With GitHub, you can:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Share your code with the world (or just your team).</li>
          <li>Access your code from multiple devices.</li>
          <li>Publish your projects online.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <strong>Important Note:</strong> When we use Git commands in the
          terminal, we're talking to Git, not GitHub. GitHub is where we'll host
          your code, but Git is the tool that makes it all possible.
