          At this point, you've cloned the part of the repository we need. Now,
          it's time to move your own files into the cloned repository so
          everything is in one place. This step ensures that your portfolio
          website and workshop files are ready to go.
        </p>
        <h2>Command</h2>
        <p>Run the following commands to move your files:</p>
        <pre><span class="standard-command">mv</span> <code>&lt;source_file_or_folder&gt;</code> hosting-your-site/clone-this/</pre>
        <h2>Explanation</h2>

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
          After moving your files, the <code>clone-this</code> folder should now
          contain:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The starter files you cloned from the repository.</li>
          <li>Your portfolio files.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You're all set to commit and push your changes, which weâ€™ll cover in
          the next step.
