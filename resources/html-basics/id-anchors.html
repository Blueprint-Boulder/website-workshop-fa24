    <p>
      The <code>id</code> attribute uniquely identifies an element on a page.
      IDs can be used to link to specific parts of a page or as a hook for
      styling with CSS and interacting with JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let's see how anchor tags can help us navigate through different sections
      of a long article. We'll use an example article about platypuses (written
      by my good friend, Mr. GPT) and structure it into four sections: General
      Information, Habitat, Predators, and Cool Platypus Features.

      <h2>General Information</h2>
      <p>
        The platypus is one of the most unusual creatures in the animal kingdom.
        It is a semi-aquatic mammal that is native to Australia. While it may
        look like a mix between a beaver and a duck, the platypus is in a family
        all by itself. In fact, it is one of the only five existing species of
        monotremes â€” mammals that lay eggs instead of giving birth to live
        young.
      </p>
      <p>
        With its webbed feet, bill, and beaver-like tail, the platypus is
        adapted for life both in and out of the water. It feeds on insects and
        small aquatic creatures, which it hunts using its unique ability to
        sense electrical fields.

    <!-- Habitat Section -->
    <section id="habitat">
      <h2>Habitat</h2>
      <p>
        Platypuses are found in freshwater environments such as rivers, streams,
        and lakes across eastern Australia and Tasmania. They prefer slow-moving
        waters with plenty of overhanging vegetation and debris that provide
        shelter and protection. They dig burrows into the riverbanks, where they
        rest and lay their eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ideal platypus habitat has both water for foraging and secluded
        areas for nesting. These habitats are critical for their survival, as
        changes in water levels or pollution can have a significant impact on
        their populations.

    <!-- Predators Section -->
    <section id="predators">
      <h2>Predators</h2>
      <p>
        While the platypus does not have many natural predators, it is still
        vulnerable to certain threats. Birds of prey such as hawks and eagles
        may target young or smaller platypuses. Introduced species like foxes
        and feral cats can also pose a danger, particularly to nesting females
        and eggs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human activities such as habitat destruction, water pollution, and
        climate change also present significant threats to platypus populations.
        Conservation efforts focus on preserving their habitats and minimizing
        human impact.

    <!-- Cool Features Section -->
    <section id="cool-features">
      <h2>Cool Platypus Features</h2>
      <h3>1. Electroreception</h3>
      <p>
        One of the most remarkable features of the platypus is its ability to
        sense electrical fields in the water. This adaptation, called
        electroreception, helps the platypus detect the movements of its prey
        even with its eyes closed. The electroreceptors are located in the skin
        of the platypus's bill, which it uses to scan the riverbed for food.
      </p>
      <h3>2. Venomous Spur</h3>
      <p>
        Male platypuses have a venomous spur on their hind legs, which they use
        for defense and possibly in mating battles with other males. The venom
        can cause severe pain in humans and is potent enough to immobilize
        smaller animals.
