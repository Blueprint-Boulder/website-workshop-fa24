    <h1>Images in HTML</h1>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag is used to display images on a webpage.
      It is a self-closing tag that requires a <code>src</code> attribute, which
      specifies the path to the image file, and an <code>alt</code> attribute,
      which provides an alternative text description of the image.
    </p>

    <h2>Basic Image Example</h2>
    <p>Here's a basic example of using the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag:</p>
    <pre><code>&lt;img src="platypus.jpg" alt="A platypus swimming in water" /&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
      This code will display the image located at <code>platypus.jpg</code> with
      a description that reads "A platypus swimming in water." If the image
      cannot be displayed, the alt text will appear in its place, making it
      important for accessibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Using the &lt;figure&gt; and &lt;figcaption&gt; Elements</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code> element is used to group images with their
      captions, making them easier to associate. You can include multiple images
      in a figure or use it to wrap other types of media. The
      <code>&lt;figcaption&gt;</code> element provides a caption for the content
      inside <code>&lt;figure&gt;</code>.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img src="platypus.jpg" alt="A platypus swimming in water" />
      <figcaption>
        Figure 1: A platypus swimming in its natural habitat.

      As well as linking from your own computer, you can also use absolute
      links.
    </p>

        alt="A platypus diving"

    <h2>Image Paths</h2>
    <p>
      When specifying the <code>src</code> attribute in an
      <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag, you can use either a relative path or an
      absolute path:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Relative Path</strong>: <code>src="images/platypus.jpg"</code> —
        Points to an image in a folder called "images" relative to the current
        file.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Absolute Path</strong>:
        <code>src="https://example.com/platypus.jpg"</code> — Points to an image
        located at an external URL.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Image Attributes</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> attributes allow you to set
      the dimensions of an image in pixels, but it's often better to control the
      size with CSS to keep your code clean. Avoid using these attributes if the
      image is meant to be responsive.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also use CSS properties like <code>max-width</code> and
      <code>height</code> to ensure your images resize correctly based on screen
      size.
    </p>

    <h2>Responsive Images</h2>
    <p>To make your images responsive, use the following CSS properties:</p>
    <pre><code>img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      This will ensure that the image scales down to fit within its container
      without exceeding its original dimensions.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility with Alt Text</h2>
    <p>
      Always include an <code>alt</code> attribute for every image. The text
      should describe the content and function of the image. If an image is
      purely decorative, you can use an empty alt attribute like this:
      <code>alt=""</code>. This tells screen readers to skip the image,
      improving the accessibility of your site.
