    <h1>The &lt;p&gt; Tag and HTML Structure</h1>
    <p>
      The <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag defines a paragraph in HTML. By default,
      paragraphs are block-level elements, which means they take up the full
      width available and each paragraph starts on a new line (we'll talk more
      about this when we see div vs. span).
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add multiple paragraphs like this to separate text, making your
      content more readable.

    <h2>HTML5: The Latest Evolution</h2>
    <p>
      HTML has undergone several versions since its inception. The current
      version, HTML5, introduced many new features and elements that improve the
      way we build modern websites and applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the key reasons for the continuous evolution of HTML are to
      address emerging web development needs, ensure better compatibility with
      new devices, and offer more powerful tools for creating complex web pages.
      HTML5 also focuses on simplifying code and removing outdated or redundant
      elements, making web development more efficient.
    </p>
    <h3>Why HTML5 Matters</h3>
    <p>
      HTML5 brings new semantic elements like <code>&lt;article&gt;</code>,
      <code>&lt;section&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> that help
      define the structure of your content more clearly. It also supports
      multimedia with elements like <code>&lt;audio&gt;</code> and
      <code>&lt;video&gt;</code>, eliminating the need for third-party plugins.
      This version emphasizes making content more accessible and maintaining a
      cleaner, more meaningful structure.
    </p>
    <h3>Backwards Compatibility</h3>
    <p>
      A crucial feature of HTML5 is its backwards compatibility. Older websites
      built with earlier HTML versions will still work in modern browsers,
      ensuring a smooth transition as new features are introduced.
    </p>
    <h2>Whitespace in HTML</h2>
    <p>
      HTML ignores extra whitespace characters such as spaces, tabs, and
      newlines, treating them as a single space. For example, if you type
      multiple spaces or press 'Enter' several times in your code, the browser
      will collapse these into a single space when rendering the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is why it's common to see HTML written in an indented format, as it
      helps organize code without affecting the actual layout. To add
      intentional whitespace, use the <code>&lt;br&gt;</code> tag to create a
      line break or the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> entity to insert a non-breaking
      space.
