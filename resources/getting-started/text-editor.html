        <h2>What is a Text Editor?</h2>
        <p>
          A text editor is a tool that programmers use to write and edit code.
          Think of it as a specialized version of a word processor like
          Microsoft Word, but designed specifically for coding. Text editors
          help format your code, highlight errors, and sometimes even provide
          helpful shortcuts or extensions.

        <h2>Do You <em>Need</em> to Install a Text Editor?</h2>
        <p>
          Strictly speaking, no. It's possible to modify files using your
          Command Line Terminal, and Mac, Windows and Linux all have built in
          text editors.
        </p>
        <p>
          In fact, the Microsoft Word analogy is no joke. Check out this video
          where Joma Tech uses Word to code!
