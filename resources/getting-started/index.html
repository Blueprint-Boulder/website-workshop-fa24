        <h2>Introduction to Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          In this section, we'll cover some of the absolute basics you need to
          know to get started with web dev.

        <h2>What is Web Development?</h2>
        <p>
          Web development is the process of creating websites or web
          applications that are available over the internet. It combines both
          design (how a website looks) and functionality (how a website works).
          Web development is typically divided into two parts:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Frontend Development</strong>:This is what users see and
            interact with. It includes languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
            to create the visual structure and style of a website.
          </li>
          <p>
            <em>
              Note: For the purposes of the workshop, we'll only be discussing
              HTML/CSS. JavaScript will be covered in a future workshop though!
            </em>
          </p>
          <li>
            <strong>Backend Development</strong>: This is what happens behind
            the scenes. It includes servers, databases, and scripts that process
            user requests, store information, and send data back to the user's
            browser, using languages like Python, SQL, and JavaScript (again).
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Websites Work: The Basics</h2>
        <p>
          When you click on a link or type a URL (like
          <code>www.example.com</code>) into your browser, several things happen
          behind the scenes:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Your browser sends a request over the internet to a server (a
            computer that stores website files) asking for the content of the
            page.
          </li>
          <li>
            The server processes this request and sends back the necessary
            files, such as HTML, CSS, images, or JavaScript, to your browser.
          </li>
          <li>
            Your browser then <strong>reads</strong> the HTML file to understand
            the structure of the page, <strong>applies</strong> CSS to style it,
            and <strong>runs</strong> any JavaScript to add interactivity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Finally, your browser renders the website on your screen, showing
            you the completed page.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>
          Think of this process like ordering a book from an online store:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>You (the browser)</strong> place an order for a book.</li>
          <li>
            <strong>The online store's warehouse (the server)</strong> processes
            your order and sends the book to your house.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>You open and read the book (rendering the website)</strong>
            and can enjoy the content that was sent to you.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each time you click a link or navigate to a new page, a similar
          request is made. This is how the internet connects you to various
          websites and information.
        </p>

        <h2>HTML and CSS in Web Development</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you know how websites work, let's break down the role of HTML
          and CSS:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</strong> This is the
            standard language for creating web pages. HTML provides the
            structure of the page, defining elements like headings, paragraphs,
            links, images, and more. It's like the skeleton of a website.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> This is used to style
            and layout your web pages. CSS controls colors, fonts, spacing, and
            positioning of HTML elements. It's like adding skin and clothes to
            the skeleton, giving the website its look and feel.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          In the following sections, we'll dive deeper into each of these
          technologies, showing you how to build and style your very first web
          pages.
