            Hi! I'm Luca, a Junior at CU currently studying Economics and Data
            Science, though I want to tranfer to Comp Sci.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm deeply passionate about animation/game development, and my dream
            would be to one day have my own studio where I produce
            games/animations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy blending creative and technical skills to create compelling
            stories, and using these stories to help out my communities.

          <p>
            From a young age, I've been fascinated by how games and animations
            can captivate audiences, evoke emotions, and create shared
            experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that technology can be a powerful tool for storytelling
            and social change, and I want to use my skills to create meaningful
            experiences that inspire and connect people.

            I'm currently serving as the Vice President of Data Buffs at CU
            Boulder, a student-run organization focused on leveraging data
            science to solve real-world problems. I'm actively working on a
            collaborative project with CU Women's Basketball to analyze team

            As the Workshop Coordinator for Blueprint Boulder, I organize and
            lead workshops that equip students with technical and professional
            skills. From web development to project management, I strive to
            build an inclusive learning environment where students can grow
            their skillsets in order to join a future project, should they
            choose to.
